## 💡 Summary  

I’m a **Flutter developer with 3+ years of hands-on experience** in building and leading real-world, cross-platform mobile applications.  
I’ve completed **5+ full-cycle projects**, taking ownership from development to deployment, and worked with **international clients** delivering high-quality products.  

Started my career with limited experience but grew through **self-learning and consistency**, becoming capable of managing **multiple projects independently**.  
I’ve also **mentored a junior developer** who now handles end-to-end app development.  

My expertise includes building **real-time chat**, **location tracking (via WebSockets & location services)**, **in-app PDF signing/generation**, **interactive push notifications**, **deep linking**, and **multi-language support** — all **without paid SDKs**.
